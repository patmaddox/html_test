<h1>Home</h1>
<p>This is my home page. It links to <a href="another_page.html">another page</a>. Also a <a href="folder/a_nested_page.html">nested page</a>. I want to see how DEVONthink indexes it. If I can navigate to other pages based on the relative paths.</p>
<p>It works pretty well, but the &#x201c;reveal file&#x201d; functionality doesn&#x2019;t work all that well with indexed stuff. I can navigate from one file to another, but DEVONthink doesn&#x2019;t realize that I&#x2019;m looking at files inside the database. It just treats it as a normal link. Still, I can use the &#x201c;similar to&#x201d; feature to find the document inside the database if I want.</p>
